# Terminal_video_player
Personal project where I try to make a program that "plays videos" on a terminal with my mostly non-existing programming skills.

# How to use this

In addition, you should be aware that, if your computer has the same specs as your microwave, this will very likely work bad and will probably hurt your eyes.
